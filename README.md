# Subreddit Post Classification - Data Engineering Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to preprocess a dataset of Reddit posts to train a machine learning algorithm that classifies posts into specific subreddits. The dataset used is from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/1043504#.Wzt7PbhXryo), and preprocessing is done on an Ubuntu server.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Zenodo Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/1043504#.Wzt7PbhXryo)
- **Description:** Contains Reddit posts with metadata, requiring preprocessing to extract meaningful features.

## Objectives
1. Preprocess text data for ML training.
2. Implement feature engineering techniques.
3. Train and evaluate classification models.
4. Deploy a trained model for inference.
